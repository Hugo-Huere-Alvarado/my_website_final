# IMDB ratings: Differences between directors

Recall the IMBD ratings data. I would like you to explore whether the mean IMDB rating for Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton are the same or not. I have already calculated the confidence intervals for the mean ratings of these two directors and as you can see they overlap. 


```{r directors, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "directors.png"), error = FALSE)
```

First, I would like you to reproduce this graph. You may find `geom_errorbar()` and `geom_rect()` useful.

In addition, you will run a hypothesis test. You should use both the `t.test` command and the `infer` package to simulate from a null distribution, where you assume zero difference between the two.

> Before anything, write down the null and alternative hypotheses, as well as the resulting test statistic and the associated t-stat or p-value. At the end of the day, what do you conclude?

You can load the data and examine its structure

```{r load-movies-data}
movies <- read_csv(here::here("data", "movies.csv"))
glimpse(movies)
```

# Your R code and analysis should go here. If you want to insert a blank chunk of R code you can just hit `Ctrl/Cmd+Alt+I` 
```{r}

## Reproducing the graph

movies_v1 <- movies %>% filter(director == "Steven Spielberg" | director == "Tim Burton") %>% select(director | rating)

movies_v2 <- movies_v1 %>%
  group_by(director) %>%
  summarise(mean_rating = mean(rating, na.rm=TRUE),
            sd_rating = sd(rating, na.rm = TRUE),
            count = n(),
            se_rating = sd_rating/sqrt(count),
            t_critical = qt(0.975, count-1), 
            margin_of_error = t_critical * se_rating,
            lower = mean_rating - t_critical * se_rating,
            upper = mean_rating + t_critical * se_rating
            )

p <- ggplot(movies_v2, aes(mean_rating, reorder(director, mean_rating), colour = director)) +
  labs(title = "Do Spielberg and Burton have the same mean IMDB ratings?", subtitle = "95% confidence intervals overlap", x= "Mean IMDB Rating", y = "") +
  theme_bw() + theme(legend.position = "none") +
  geom_point(size = 7) +
  geom_text(aes(label = round(mean_rating, 2)), vjust = -1.2, size = 7, colour = "black") +
  geom_text(aes(x = upper, label = round(upper, 2)), vjust = -1.6, size = 5, colour = "black") +
  geom_text(aes(x = lower, label = round(lower, 2)), vjust = -1.6, size = 5, colour = "black") +
  geom_errorbar(movies_v2, mapping = aes(x=mean_rating, xmin=upper, xmax=lower, y = director), width = 0.1,    size = 2.5) +
  geom_rect(aes(xmin = lower[1], xmax = upper[2], ymin = 0, ymax = 3), colour = "grey", alpha = 0.2)

p


## Hypothesis test with formula

movies <- movies %>%
  mutate(spielberg_burton = movies$director %in% c("Steven Spielberg", "Tim Burton"))

movies %>% filter(!is.na(spielberg_burton)) %>% 
  group_by(spielberg_burton) %>% 
  summarise(count = n()) %>% 
  mutate(prop= count/sum(count))

t.test(rating ~ spielberg_burton, data = movies)

## Hypothesis test with infer

obs_diff <- movies %>%
  specify(rating ~ spielberg_burton) %>%
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c(TRUE, FALSE))
obs_diff


null_dist <- movies %>%
  specify(rating ~ spielberg_burton) %>%
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>%
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "permute") %>%
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c(TRUE, FALSE))
null_dist

ggplot(data = null_dist, aes(x = stat)) +
  geom_histogram()
  
null_dist %>% visualize() +
  shade_p_value(obs_stat = obs_diff, direction = "two-sided")

null_dist %>%
  get_p_value(obs_stat = obs_diff, direction = "two_sided")
```
